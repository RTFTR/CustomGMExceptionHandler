<h1 align="center">CustomGMExceptionHandler</h1>

**CustomGMExceptionHandler** is a tool to make a custom Gamemaker games' exception handler system.

## Logic

To be specific, I used ```exception_unhandled_handler()``` and ```game_change()``` in order to make it work.

```exception_unhandled_handler()``` will let us handle the exception by ourselves,
```game_change()``` will let us change the client into ```CrashHandler.win```.
